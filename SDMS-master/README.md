This repository is for the mini projects which is a student management system



Java Project : Students Dairy

This project was first built with many classes and later on reduced and made the classes
only if they are needed and the common functions are completely utilized using the oops concepts.

This project is mainly build through HashMap and few text files. Initially the project
has three students. We can perform any operations on them including viewing thier academic and
personal activities and performance.These details can be inputed by the councellor
and faculty and can be viewed by the students and parents.

The main block used in this project is HashMap, because pairing the details of the
student with his roll number is quite easy.
